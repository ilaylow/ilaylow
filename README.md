### Hey hey! /^-^/
Thanks for landing on and checking out my GitHub! Here you'll mostly find a mix of projects however I'm currently working on projects that mainly involve **Computer Vision** and **ReactJS**!

- 🦾 As of now I'm currently working on mapping my hand, captured through a video stream, into 3 Dimensional space, so that I can map it to a robotic arm by Adeept that I've recently built. Check out the progress here! Project Repository: https://github.com/ilaylow/Vision-Controlled-Arm-Bot
- 💻 I'm also working on a SortingVisualiser website in collaboration with https://github.com/CodingPengwing. The website aims to help users visualise the process of different sorting algorithms and will hopefully aid in understanding how these algorithms operate! (It also looks pretty dang cool :eyes:) Website: https://codingpengwing.github.io/SortingVisualizer/
- 📖 I've also begun working on a Basic Diary/Task Tracker website utilising the MERN stack with TypeScript. The website will allow users to create an account and login to see their individual tasks for the day. The user will also be able to view past tasks set in previous dates. Check it out here! (Still in Early Development) Repository: https://github.com/ilaylow/Diary_App
- 🖱️ Lastly, I'm experimenting with Gesture Detection, Pose Detection, Hand Tracking and other Image Operations with Python's OpenCV Library + Google's Mediapipe models in https://github.com/ilaylow/Hand_Tracker_Mouse_V2. All experiments are still in relatively early stages however finger->mouse tracking and finger counting have been successfully trialed with a good degree of stability.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Burritos are my favourite thing in the world!
