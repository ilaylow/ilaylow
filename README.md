### Hey hey!
Thanks for landing on and checking out my GitHub! Here you'll mostly find a mix of projects however I'm currently working on projects that mainly involve **Computer Vision** and **ReactJS**!

- ðŸ”­ As of now I'm currently working on mapping my hand, captured through a video stream, into 3 Dimensional space, so that I can map it to a robotic arm by Adeept that I've recently built. Check out the progress here! Project Repository: https://github.com/ilaylow/Vision-Controlled-Arm-Bot
- ðŸ”­ I'm also working on a SortingVisualiser website in collaboration with https://github.com/CodingPengwing. The website aims to help users visualise the process of different sorting algorithms and will hopefully aid in understanding how these algorithms operate! (It also looks pretty dang cool :eyes:)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Burritos are my faovurite thing in the world!
