### Hey hey! /^-^/
Thanks for landing on and checking out my GitHub! Here you'll mostly find a mix of projects however I'm currently working on projects that mainly involve **Computer Vision** and **ReactJS**!

- 🦾 As of now I'm currently working on mapping my hand, captured through a video stream, into 3 Dimensional space, so that I can map it to a robotic arm by Adeept that I've recently built. Check out the progress here! Project Repository: https://github.com/ilaylow/Vision-Controlled-Arm-Bot
- 💻 I'm also working on a SortingVisualiser website in collaboration with https://github.com/CodingPengwing. The website aims to help users visualise the process of different sorting algorithms and will hopefully aid in understanding how these algorithms operate! (It also looks pretty dang cool :eyes:)
- 🖱️ Lastly, I'm experimenting with Gesture Detection, Pose Detection, Hand Tracking and other Image Operations with Python's OpenCV Library + Google's Mediapipe models in https://github.com/ilaylow/Hand_Tracker_Mouse_V2. All experiments are still in relatively early stages however finger->mouse tracking and finger counting have been successfully trialed with a good degree of stability.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Burritos are my favourite thing in the world!
